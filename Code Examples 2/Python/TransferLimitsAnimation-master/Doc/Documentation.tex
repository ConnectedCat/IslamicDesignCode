\begin{abstract}
This document is a LaTeX template for creating code documentation. It is typeset
\emph{report} document class, which means that it has chapters and sections.
The main purpose of the document is to illustrate it's use of figures and listings,
but it also showcases cross referencing bibliography entries, etc.

\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:intro}
This is a template LaTeX file useful when preparing software documentation. It
is compiled with pdflatex using included DOS batch file called runAll.bat. In
the following report, we are documenting the process of creating a graph needed
for a presentation.
\section{Including and captioning figures}
\label{sec:figures}
The first step was to create the circle that would be the basis of the graph.
This is done in the following lines of code:
\singlespacing
\lstinputlisting[language=python,caption={\lstname},label=lst:2, linerange={395-397}]{code/base_frame_v1.py}
\doublespacing

Theta(th) is defined by a range from 0 to 2pi, with a step of pi/100. The smaller
the step, the more accurate and defined the circle is.

For the purpose of this graph, five areas were created to represent different
points throughout the circle. This is done in the following lines of code:
\singlespacing
\lstinputlisting[language=python,caption={\lstname},label=lst:3, linerange={296-301}]{code/base_frame_v1.py}
\doublespacing

The reference points, marked in gray, on the circle were created by creating an theta range from
0 to 2pi, with a step of 2pi divided by the area array. This separates the reference
points by the area array evenly.

The points on the graph were plotted using the following lines of code:
\singlespacing
\lstinputlisting[language=python,caption={\lstname},label=lst:4, linerange={312-316}]{code/base_frame_v1.py}
\doublespacing

To create the red and blue points on the circle, we needed to first determine if
the vector from i to j passes to the right or left relative to center, looking
from each gray point individually.

To distribute the red points, we first needed to find the scalar product of the
vector from point i to j, and from point i to the origin. This is done in the
following lines of code:

\singlespacing
\lstinputlisting[language=python,caption={\lstname},label=lst:4, linerange={355-359}]{code/base_frame_v2.py}
\doublespacing

In the scalar product of these two vectors, the i and j components equal zero; the
only component left is k, which is calculated as follows; if the k component was
less than zero, it was added to the left tally, and if greater than zero, it was
added to the right tally. This is shown in the following lines of code:

\singlespacing
\lstinputlisting[language=python,caption={\lstname},label=lst:5, linerange={364-365}]{code/base_frame_v2.py}
\doublespacing
\singlespacing
\lstinputlisting[language=python,caption={\lstname},label=lst:6, linerange={373-380}]{code/base_frame_v2.py}
\doublespacing

To plot the points as (x,y) coordinates, we followed the same formula for the gray points.
However, the theta values were slightly different. For the blue points, the left tally
was subtracted, and for the red points, the right tally was added. These values were
multipled by our conversion factor flowscale, represented as rad/MW, to keep the angles
in radians. This is shown in the following lines of code, for the blue and red points, respectively:

\singlespacing
\lstinputlisting[language=python,caption={\lstname},label=lst:7, linerange={387-390}]{code/base_frame_v2.py}
\doublespacing

To plot the arcs between the gray and blue/red points, we used a 4 point Bezier curve with point 1
being the gray point, point 2 and 3 being the 'golden section' of the curve, and point 4 being the
red or blue we were trying to connect to. This is shown as follows:

\singlespacing
\lstinputlisting[language=python,caption={\lstname},label=lst:8, linerange={87-107}]{code/base_frame_v2.py}
\doublespacing


Because the right and left tallies were organized in arrays and not points,

This plots the gray points shown in the following figure: Fig.~\ref{fig:AreaMarkers}.

\section{Other formatting}
We saw in \ref{sec:figures} how to include figures.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Preprocess historic AMI data to enable study based on actual measurements.
  \item Execute OpenDSS in snapshot mode to review voltage contours at a wide
        range of operating conditions.
  \item Review the resulting patterns and place OpenDSS \emph{monitors} at
        nodes that experience greatest voltage change.
  \item Execute OpenDSS in temporal mode to collect temporal voltage recordings
        at monitored nodes.
  \item Review voltage histograms at monitored buses to quantify the frequency
        and magnitude of voltage excursions.
\end{enumerate}
\doublespacing

In the following sections, we briefly describe the tool-chains that facilitate
this process.
