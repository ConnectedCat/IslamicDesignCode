Islamic Art Patterns 
=====================

This project is a naive attempt at replicating some Art Patterns from the Islamic epoch and animating them in interesting ways.

Basically this project is written for Processing, however it's **100% portable** to processing.js (http://processingjs.org) and an implementation of it can be found on my website
(http://bassemdy.com)

No setup is needed. Just run the code in processing and you'll be good to go.

Btw, TriangloPod: I have no idea why I came up with that name or from where...

Installation
------------

Starting v0.11 I implemented ControlP5 Library. So in order to run this project you need to download and install the library.

**ControlP5** : http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/

Usage
-----

Use the sliders on the top left corner for manipulation.

The below is **obsolete** starting v0.11:

    'p': Increase the number of points used in the TriangloPod
    'l': Decrease the number of points used in the TriangloPod
    'o': Increase the outer radius
    'k': Decrease the outer radius
    'i': Increase the inner radius
    'j': Decrease the inner radius
